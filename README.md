  * for more languages, you can help translation by going to the [locales](https://github.com/oriko-mikuni/oriko-mikuni.github.io/tree/main/src/locales) folder and following these steps:
    * Copy all `.json` file in `en` folder and paste them in a new folder, named by your language (e.g. `de`).
    * Translate all the value strings in the new files.
      * Do not change the key (strings on the left of `:`).
      * Do not translate anything wrapped by `{}`, they are icons and should remain the same
      * Wrap the **bold** content by `**` and wrap the *italic* content by `[]`
    * Then you can send a pull request.
#### TODO for Card Maker
